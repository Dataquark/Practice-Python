Because it would take a long time for you to input the months of various scientists, you can use [my scientist birthday JSON file](https://www.practicepython.org/assets/scientist_birthdays.json). Just parse out the months (if you don’t know how, I suggest looking at the previous exercise or its solution) and draw your histogram.*"
